        <h1>The Contrast Between GitHub and Sites at Penn State</h1>
        <section>
            <p class="ind">Coming to the completion of both websites on Github and Sites at Penn State, many conclusions have been drawn. The difference in complexity and intricacy can very clearly be noticed between the two. This report will go into detail about those differences.</p>
                
                <p class="ind">Between working with both sites, the most significant challenges for a new learner would stem from the GitHub site. This is for a couple of reasons. HTML code is not particularly hard to work with, but the CSS styling can be tricky because of how many different codes there are for different styling aspects. The concept of having to create an entire other page for styling is also a cause for concern - whereas in the Sites at Penn State - it is very easy to click customize and be able to visually see the customization.</p> 
                
            <p class="ind">The Sites at Penn State and GitHub both have their personal advantages. For example, Sites at Penn State allows for you to be able to see your site while creating it, although with GitHub, you can only write code and continuously test it. Modifying the layout with Sites at Penn State was quite easy, but lacked personalization. There were limited choices for the layout. With GitHub, it is much harder to control the layout, but you can almost fully customize it to your liking once you get the hang of it. </p>
                
            <p class="ind">When it comes to skills, Sites at Penn State is the winner. You need very basic document forming skills when it comes to making a website there. GitHub is much harder for someone who doesnâ€™t know how to code. If you do know some coding language -, and have prior software development skills - then coding with GitHub is conventionally easy. Personally, to improve my website, I would love to learn Java. Java script would allow me to make the website much more fun and interactive.</p>
                
            <p class="ind">Overall, Sites at Penn State is quicker and easier to use, but GitHub allows for you to express yourself and your website in a way that would not be possible on Sites at Penn State. Both are very nice platforms in their own ways, and have taught me unique skills catered to each.
