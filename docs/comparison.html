        <h1>Suspense Radioplays Vs. All The Radioplays Except Suspense</h1>
        <section>
            <p class="ind" style="font-size:110%;"><b>My corpus text analysis is based off of the radioplays provided by Dr. B <a href="https://github.com/newtfire/introDH-Hub/tree/master/textFiles/radioPlays">(you can find them here)</a>. Specifically there is a section of the "Suspense" radioplays that I have decided to compare to the rest of the radioplays without them. My goal is to see if there is a specific theme that is followed in the Suspense radioplays that is not in the other ones.</b></p>

            </figure></div>   
            <p class="spacing">When looking between the two visual concepts, it is noticable that the suspense radioplays consists more of <ins>nouns</ins>, whereas the non-suspense radioplays contains more <ins>verbs</ins> and a wider diversity of words. The suspense radioplays contain many <ins>people and objects</ins>, with many of them being specific names. The non-suspense radioplays show an array of <ins>commands</ins> like "come", "look", and "say" which seem to be some of the most frequent I also found it interesting that they both have "sound" and "music" as some of the most frequent words.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="spacing">When the ngram size is set to 3, the frequencies and phrases are very similar between the two, but if you look specifically at the words with the KWIC, you can see that they're used in different manners in the <b>images down below</b>.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="spacing">When looking at the word "don't" between the two, it becomes apparent that they are used in different manners. The suspense radioplays have a pattern of starting with a <ins>"Why" and following with a "you"</ins>. They are being said as <ins>commands or questions</ins> told to another person. Meanwhile, the non-suspense radioplays do not command others. Instead, they mostly start with an <ins>"I" and follow with "know"</ins>, showing that the contexts between the two differ grealty. While the suspense focuses on commanding another party, the non-suspense is more of a <ins>first person confession</ins>, revealing their own lack of knowledge.</p>

            <p class="spacing">Although earlier, using an ngram size of 3 created a scenario where the two were very similar, bumping it up to <b>5</b> shows significant difference. The suspense radioplays become a little confusing at this part because they seem to be mostly <ins>code</ins>, whereas the non-suspense are all <ins>coherent sentences</ins>. I found a couple things very interesting between these ngrams. The first being that all of the non-suspense sentences start with <ins>"I'm"</ins>. The second being that the suspense radioplays from 1-22 all have the same exact <ins>rank, frequency, and range.</ins></p>

            <p class="spacing">Using the word "going" in the KWICs has led to some interesting finds. The first thing I noticed in these images is that in the suspense radioplays, a large amount talks about <ins>killing and calling the police</ins>. The next thing I noticed was that the suspense radioplays talk more about <ins>specific people</ins>, especially using the word "I'm", which I would have predicted the non-suspense radioplays to have more of. The non-suspense radioplays all have <ins>"be" directly after "to"</ins>. Although, when referring to the subject, the non-suspense radioplays are referring to <ins>"this", "is", and "there"</ins>.</p>

            <p class="spacing">In conclusion, I have found a couple of interesting things while analyzing these texts through Corpus Anaylsis. One of the main things that I have discovered is that the non-suspense radioplays are reffereing to themselves in a first person perspective much more than the suspense radioplays, which seem to refer to others more. The non-suspense radioplays also contain many commands which has been a common theme within them. The suspense radioplays have provided some interesting words and details that stand out a little more than the non-suspense that create curiosity. Especially with the killing and calling the police. I am very intrigued as to what that could be pertaining to. In all, they have similar attributes which is to be expected since they are all radioplays, but there are also very clear differences.</p>
