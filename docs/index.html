            <p class="home">This website is a virtual art gallery of my artworks. Most of my portfolio answers the inquiry: What is the reality of being a woman? My portfolio is meant to bring awareness to issues that women face in life. My goal is to help others feel understood and seen.</p>

            <p class="home">As I embarked on this artistic journey, I poured all of myself into each piece. I took my time carefully crafting each artwork to portray exactly what I wanted to portray. It took me a full year to complete all of these. This gallery to me is my greatest accomplishment. I struggled greatly and continued to push myself when I felt I couldn't keep going. The amount of work I put into these truly couldn't make me more proud of myself. I have grown so much through this journey with my skills and mentally. I will forever be greatful.</p>
