                <p>Women are constantly faced with contradictory standards from society that create
                    a need to <i>be</i> or <i>look</i> a certain way, despite what you feel on the

                <p>I created this piece by using sand and sand paper. I used sand paper to scrub
                    through to the canvas on the gashes across the skin to represent rawness. I
                    chose to make the skin red because I associated the color with burning and
                    stinging feelings. This is a piece that is meant to bring awareness to victims
                    of SA, and the intricates behind the healing procces.</p>

                <p>The story of medusa is quite a tragic one. In our society, sometimes the woman
                    can be blamed for what was done to her. It reminds me a lot of Medusa's story,
                    and how she was punished and viewed as a monster for simply being a woman. The
                    feelings of frustration, sadness, defeat, and confusion are hoped to be
                    portrayed in this piece.</p>

                    drink spiking is done to women. The top left bubble is to represent the feeling
                    of being out of control of your own body. This is represented by a skewed posed
                    woman who is tied to strings like a muppet as if someone else is controlling her
                    actions. The top right bubble shows dialated eyes that are distant and fuzzy.
                    The bottom right bubble is the realization. Staring into your cup and finally
                    noticing the fizz that was not there before.</p>

                <p>This is a literal representation of how women can be shamed for wearing too much
                    makeup. the statements "Your face is caked" or "Cake Face" are said to women a
                    lot when they wear makeup. The standards are unfair because if you don't wear
                    makeup, you're "bummy" but if you do, then you're "fake".</p>
