                    Peas represent truth. We must hide who we truly are on the inside. Only when we
                    are in the comfort of our lonliness, can we peel back the mask we have
                    fabricated, and let the truth shine through.</p>
                <p>Women are constantly faced with contradictory standards from society that create
                    a need to <i>be</i> or <i>look</i> a certain way, despite what you feel on the
                    inside.</p>

                    body will never forget the touch, not even if you scrub until your skin feels
                    raw.</p>

                <p>I created this piece by using sand and sand paper. I used sand paper to scrub
                    through to the canvas on the gashes across the skin to represent rawness. I
                    chose to make the skin red because I associated the color with burning and
                    stinging feelings. This is a piece that is meant to bring awareness to victims
                    of SA, and the intricates behind the healing procces.</p>

                <p>The story of medusa is quite a tragic one. In our society, sometimes the woman can be blamed for what was done to her. It reminds me a lot of Medusa's story, and how she was punished and viewed as a monster for simply being a woman. The feelings of frustration, sadness, defeat, and confusion are hoped to be portrayed in this piece.</p>

                <p>The objectifying saying that "women's bodies are like pieces of meat" is portrayed in this piece quite literally. The rabid dogs underneath salivating are meant to be prey. Society can really scew the way we see people.</p>

                <p>This piece is meant to represent the feelings of someone who was roofied. 74% of drink spiking is done to women. The top left bubble is to represent the feeling of being out of control of your own body. This is represented by a skewed posed woman who is tied to strings like a muppet as if someone else is controlling her actions. The top right bubble shows dialated eyes that are distant and fuzzy. The bottom right bubble is the realization. Staring into your cup and finally noticing the fizz that was not there before.</p>
