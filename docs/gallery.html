                    Peas represent truth. We must hide who we truly are on the inside. Only when we are in the comfort of our lonliness, can we peel back the mask we have fabricated, and let the truth shine through.</p>
                <p>Women are constantly faced with contradictory standards
                    from society that create a need to <i>be</i> or <i>look</i> a certain way, despite what you
                    feel on the inside.</p>

                    feels raw.</p>

                <p>I created this piece by using sand and sand paper. I used sand paper to scrub through to the canvas on the gashes across the skin to represent rawness. I chose to make the skin red because I associated the color with burning and stinging feelings. This is a piece that is meant to bring awareness to victims of SA, and the intricates behind the healing procces.</p>
