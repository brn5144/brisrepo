This publication, produced to accompany an exhibition in the Belvedere, Vienna, is the first to focus on his portraits and self-portraits. Schiele was influenced by Gustav Klimt during his early career but soon discovered his own mode of expression. By the time of his premature death he had created an impressive oeuvre that concentrates on the depiction of the human figure. In his portraits, Schiele tried to portray his models' state of mind in visual terms, thereby following contemporary developments in psychoanalysis. His numerous self-portraits attest to the fact that the artist embarked on his exploration of human emotions by observing his own personality. Some 100 portraits and self-portraits document Schiele's artistic development and his extraordinary accomplishments as a portraitist. Confrontational and often explicitly erotic, they repeatedly provoked protest by testing the boundaries of traditional portraiture. Largely devoid of props or scenery, they reflect the artist's intensive study of the portrayal of emotional states. Schiele's examination of the self began with his own person: his self-portraits are fascinating glimpses inside the mind of an extraordinarily gifted artist as well as seminal works of originality and deep empathy with the human condition","2011","2025-04-21 14:42:05","2025-05-08 15:17:13","","","263","","","","","Egon Schiele","","","","","Prestel","Munich ; New York","","","","","","Library Catalog (Blacklight)","N6811.5.S34 A4 2011","","","","https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/7518119","interlibrary","Criticism and interpretation; Exhibitions; Schiele, Egon; Schloss Belvedere (Vienna, Austria); Self-portraits Exhibitions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"FP4EGBBF","book","2014","","Egon Schiele: portraits","","978-3-7913-5419-4","","","","This book accompanies a major exhibition devoted to portraits created by Austrian artist Egon Schiele, whose figurative work exhibits intense emotion and technical brilliance. Egon Schiele (1890-1918) was one of the greatest artists of the twentieth century. A superb draftsman and colorist, he produced images of startling emotional power. Following the lead of his mentor, Gustav Klimt, Schiele created figurative works of uncanny intimacy and brought a new openness to the art of his time. Schiele's premature death at the age of 28 has added a mythic quality to his artistic achievements. Egon Schiele: Portraits focuses on five groupings of the artist's work: family and academy, fellow artists, sitters and patrons, lovers, and allegory. In addition, it features a special section on a traumatic and pivotal period in Schiele's life: his arrest and imprisonment during the summer of 1912. Documenting the artist's changing style, both pre- and post-imprisonment, the book features many key works that have been assembled for this exhibition from both American and European museums and private collections","2014","2025-04-21 14:42:42","2025-05-08 15:17:04","","","295","","","","","Egon Schiele","","","","","Prestel ; Neue Galerie","Munich : New York","","","","","","Library Catalog (Blacklight)","N6811.5.S34 A4 2014","OCLC: 892303544","","","https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/13410715","interlibrary","1900 - 1999; 20th century; Exhibition catalogs; Exhibitions; Portraits, Austrian; Schiele, Egon; Themes, motives","Comini, Alessandra; Lauder, Ronald S.; Price, Renée; Bauer, Christian; Schiele, Egon; Neue Galerie New York","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
